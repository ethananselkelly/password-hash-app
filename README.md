## Getting Started

To start this project please go to Datastax to sign up for a free database.

Follow the steps in the tutorial here on how to create your database on the Datastax Astra Dashboard.

.env
Now create a .env file in the root of your project with the following:

To run this project please type the following commands:

npm i
This will install all the necessary dependencies.

npm run dev
This will start the frontend and the backend, and open up the app http://localhost:3000.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

To learn React, check out the React documentation.
